### Design Plan
To make a website accessible, the following items need to be implemented at the very least:

1. Must have proper contrast ratio.

2. Do not rely solely on color to relay information.

3. Label forms clearly and properly.

4. Provide feedback for errors or additional content.

5. Must be keyboard accessible.

6. Consistent navigation layout.

7. Simple headings and spacing.

8. A responsive design.

9. Give users control.

10. Offer alternatives for media type.
